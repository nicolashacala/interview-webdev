# Interview of a Web Developer

As a first individual project during the BeCode training, we had to hold an interview with a Web Developer and then create a website about it.
I could interview some team members of [8Trust](https://www.8trust.com/) and you will find their answers on the GitHub page of this repo.

The goals of this project were obviously getting a first contact with professionals coding for a living but also being able to create a multipages website.
Moreover we had to focus on our HTML structure and semantic.
