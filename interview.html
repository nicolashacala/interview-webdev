	<h1>Why the Web Development?</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>Jean-Charles:</dt>
		<dd>Since kid, I was fond of IT and in particularly computer games. That lead me learning the web development by creating a website for a guild I was a member of in a game.</dd>
		<dd>After learning by myself, I found a job in a web agency where, after few years working, I met Alexis. At the time we met, we had the opportunity to start our own business, so we went for it.</dd>
		<dd>8Trust is now about to reach its 4th year anniversary.</dd>
		<dt>Katrin: </dt>
		<dd>A bit more than a year ago, I realised I was a bit bored careerwise. I am this kind of person who needs challenge to stay interested. I then looked for a domain that could meet this criteria and so I found the web development.</dd>
		<dd>The way coding challenges yourself plus the fast pace technologies evolve at drew my attention right away.</dd>
		<dd>After a 6 months training in coding and few months looking for a job, 8Trust was the first company who gave me a chance despite the fact I had no experience in web development.</dd>

	<h1>To be a good web developer...</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>Jean-Charles: </dt>
		<dd>When you learn coding, you like to challenge yourslef by making fancy design, including complicated features... That shouldn't be an issue as it demonstrates your passion. However, when you code as a job, you need to learn how to put your ego aside and focus on the criteria that your project needs to meet. I unfortunatly have encountered this issue in many web developers.</dd>
		<dt>Katrin: </dt>
		<dd>I'd say you will need the passion. With the passion, you will be able to keep going when you cannot find why your code is not doing what you expect it to do. With the passion, you will be able to auto-manage yourself as this kind of job offers a certain freedom.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h1>Some advice?</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>Alexis: </dt>
		<dd>Do not forget your values. It is true, in the web development there is money to make but to what price? When we started, we were working for very few costumers. The project were a bit bigger but we were earning a lot. The downside was it was easy for them to put pressure on us. Plus, we were not really proud of the products we were selling and the communication was not great. And so we decided to change our strategy to meet our values and so we started doing long term project with our costumers by first giving advise after listening to their problematics.</dd>
		<dt>Jean-Charles: </dt>
		<dd>If you like coding, just go for it. Nowadays, technologies evolve so fast and the creations of job related is increasing as well. Not only demands for jobs already existing but also new kind of jobs.</dd>
